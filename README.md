# Rabbit-Detection-in-COCO-Dataset-using-YOLO
This is repo for simple rabbit detection using YOLOv1 and AlexNet as backbone network. This task was carried out as project at LUT university CVPR Lab 




TASK PERFOMED
- Update the code by providing our own DectionNet head after feature extraction by alexnet, Restnet18 or Resnet50.
- Understand the basics of detection using deep learning models: data structure for detection (images and annotation [x, y, w, h, conf, class]) 
Loss function, detection head, generating the bounding boxes from prediction using pycocotools and other.

You can find the implementation of the tutotrials in the template file.

NOTE TAKEN:
Keeping it for now!
