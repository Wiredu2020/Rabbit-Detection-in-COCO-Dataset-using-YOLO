# Rabbit-Detection-in-COCO-Dataset-using-YOLO
This is repo for simple rabbit detection using YOLOv1 and AlexNet as backbone network. This task was carried out as project at LUT university CVPR Lab 


### **Task Summary & Key Learnings**  

#### **ðŸ”¹ Tasks Performed:**  
âœ… **Custom Detection Head Implementation** â€“ Integrated a custom **DetectionNet** head after feature extraction using **AlexNet, ResNet18, and ResNet50** to enhance object detection performance.  
âœ… **Deep Dive into Object Detection** â€“ Explored the **fundamentals of deep learning-based detection**, including the **data structure** (images & annotations: **[x, y, w, h, conf, class]**), loss functions, detection heads, and bounding box generation.  
âœ… **Practical Implementation** â€“ Utilized **pycocotools** and other essential libraries to generate bounding boxes from model predictions, ensuring accurate object localization.  

#### **ðŸ“Œ Notes Taken:**
